# Steam Dataset Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a Steam dataset using Power BI to gain insights into game performance, pricing, discounts, and reviews. The dashboard provides key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations to help understand the trends in Steam's game offerings, reviews, and pricing strategies.

## Problem Statement
The Steam platform hosts thousands of games with varying price points, review scores, and discounts. Understanding how these factors interact can provide valuable insights into market trends, customer preferences, and game performance. The main objective of this analysis is to explore the relationships between game features, pricing, and review scores, while also identifying the impact of discounts on revenue.

The analysis focuses on answering the following questions:
- What is the total number of games available on Steam?
- What is the average discount percentage applied to games, and how much potential revenue is lost due to these discounts?
- How many games are offered for free, and what is the total worth of the paid games?
- Which game features and categories receive the highest reviews?
- What are the most popular tags associated with the top-rated games?

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Total Games**: The total number of games available in the dataset.
2. **Average Discount**: The average percentage discount applied to games on Steam.
3. **Loss from Discount**: The total potential revenue loss due to discounts applied to games.
4. **Total Games Worth**: The combined worth of all games in the dataset, including the discounted and original prices.
5. **Free Games**: The total number of games available for free.

## Visualizations
1. **Top Popular Tags**: Displays the most common tags associated with the games in the dataset.
2. **Review Categories**: Shows the breakdown of games by their review categories (e.g., Positive, Mixed, Negative).
3. **Game Features by Review Category**: Analyzes how different game features (e.g., multiplayer, single-player) are reviewed by category.
4. **Free Games vs Paid Games**: A comparison of the number of free games to paid games available on Steam.

## Tables
1. **Top Highest Rated Games**: A table displaying the top 5 games with the highest review percentages.
2. **Top Worst Rated Games**: A table displaying the bottom 10 games with the lowest review percentages.

## How to Use
1. Open the Power BI file (`.pbix`) from the repository.
2. Explore the dashboard to gain insights into the Steam dataset, focusing on game performance, pricing strategies, and customer feedback.
3. Use the slicers and filters to customize the view and focus on specific tags, review categories, or game features.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis is sourced from a Steam game dataset, which includes information such as game titles, original prices, discounted prices, release dates, supported languages, popular tags, game features, review percentages, and review categories.
